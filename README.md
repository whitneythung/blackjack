This is a simple text-based Blackjack game intended to help me learn more about inheritance
in Java. This project can be complied with JDK 1.8.

The Blackjack class represents the simple Blackjack game. The Blackjack game is initialized
in this class.

The Deck class creates a deck of 52 cards. The user can shuffle the deck,
peek at the top of the deck, and draw the top card of the deck. The user can also
check the size of the deck to see if the deck is empty. There is a boolean flag
that checks if the top of the deck is an Ace.

The Card class represents the types of cards and the suit type in a Deck. The user is able to
print the contents of a card, or look at the card type or suit type.
